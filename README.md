#### Pattern lab

If everything went well you should now be able to generate the static Pattern Lab site. In the `pattern-lab` directory run:

```sh
php core/console --generate
```

#### Start the server

To start the server, in the `pattern-lab` directory run:

```sh
php core/console --server
```

#### Watch for Changes and Reload

Pattern Lab can watch for changes to files in the `source` folder and automatically rebuild the entire Pattern Lab 
website for you. Make your changes, save the file, and Pattern Lab takes care of the rest.

Install the Auto-Reload Plugin:

```sh
composer require pattern-lab/plugin-reload
```

Run the server with watch and auto reload:

```sh
php core/console --server --with-watch
```
